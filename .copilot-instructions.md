# Copilot Instructions for p3-model

## Project Overview
p3-model is a C++ object model library for podcast production and publishing (P3) under the ultralove organization. This library provides comprehensive modeling capabilities for podcast workflows, content management, and publishing processes.

## Development Guidelines

### Language & Framework
- Primary language: C/C++
- Build system: CMake
- License: MIT License

### Code Style & Standards
- Follow modern C++ best practices (C++23 standard)
- Use RAII principles for resource management
- Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers
- Use const-correctness
- All function input parameters should be const (e.g., `void SetTitle(const std::string& title)`)
- All functions that return class data without modification should be const (e.g., `std::string GetTitle() const`)
- All abstract/interface classes should have a protected virtual destructor
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - Types (classes, structs, enums): Upper PascalCase (e.g., `Episode`, `SharedObject`)
  - Functions/methods: Upper PascalCase (e.g., `GetTitle`, `SetDuration`)
  - Variables and function parameters: camelCase (e.g., `bufferSize`, `episodeCount`)
  - Member variables: camelCase with underscore postfix (e.g., `dataSize_`, `title_`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_EPISODE_LENGTH`)

### Project Structure
- All source files must be in the `ultralove::p3::model` namespace
- Keep source files organized in logical directories (e.g., `src/`, `include/`)
- Header files must use `.h` extension (not .hpp)
- Implementation files use `.cpp` extension
- File names should match the class name they contain in Upper PascalCase
  - Example: `Episode` class → `Episode.h` and `Episode.cpp`
  - Example: `SharedObject` class → `SharedObject.h` and `SharedObject.cpp`
- Use traditional include guards in all headers with format: `#ifndef __P3_FILENAME_H_INCL__`
  - Example: `#ifndef __P3_EPISODE_H_INCL__` for Episode.h
  - For multi-word filenames, convert PascalCase to UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - Example: `#ifndef __P3_SHARED_OBJECT_H_INCL__` for SharedObject.h
  - Always include project name (P3) and file name in uppercase
- All header files must specify 8-byte alignment using `#pragma pack(push, 8)` at the beginning and `#pragma pack(pop)` at the end
- Maintain clear separation between public API and implementation details
- Organize models by domain areas (e.g., content, production, publishing, metadata)

### CMake Guidelines
- Use modern CMake practices (3.15+)
- Organize CMakeLists.txt files hierarchically
- Use target-based approach with `target_*` commands
- Set appropriate compiler flags and warnings

### Documentation
- Document public APIs with clear comments
- Use Doxygen-style comments for functions and classes
- Keep README.md updated with build instructions and usage examples
- Document any dependencies and requirements

### Testing
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Consider using a testing framework like Google Test or Catch2
- Maintain good test coverage

### Git Workflow
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use feature branches for development
- When asked to commit changes:
  1. Stage all latest changes with `git add .`
  2. Write detailed but concise commit message using conventional commits
  3. Commit with `git commit -m "message"`
- Conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
  - Example: `feat(core): add initial model framework structure`

## Build Instructions
(To be updated as the project develops)

## Dependencies
(To be documented as dependencies are added)

## Architecture Notes
This library models the podcast production and publishing domain, including:
- **Content Models**: Episodes, seasons, series, transcripts, show notes
- **Production Models**: Recording sessions, editing workflows, assets management
- **Publishing Models**: Distribution channels, RSS feeds, platform integrations
- **Metadata Models**: Categories, tags, ratings, analytics
- **User Models**: Hosts, guests, producers, listeners
- **Workflow Models**: Production pipelines, approval processes, scheduling

All models should be designed for:
- Serialization/deserialization support
- Validation and business rule enforcement
- Extensibility for future podcast industry standards
- Integration with external podcast platforms and tools
